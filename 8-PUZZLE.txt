EX.NO.8 IMPLEMENT HILL CLIMBING TO SOLVE 8-PUZZLE PROBLEM

AIM - to write a python program to implement hill climbing to solve 8-puzzle problem

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Algorithm

1. Initialize initial and goal states, utility functions, and current state.
2. Begin hill climbing loop:
   - While True:
     - Generate neighboring states.
     - Calculate heuristic values for neighbors.
     - Select best neighbor with lowest heuristic.
     - If best neighbor improves heuristic, update current state and print it.
     - If no better neighbor, exit loop.
3. Check termination condition:
   - If current state equals goal state, print "Goal state reached!".
   - Otherwise, print "Local minimum reached!".
4. Execute algorithm by printing initial state and calling hill climbing with it.
