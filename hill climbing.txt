EX.NO:1A HILL CLIMBING 

algorithm:

1.Import the random module to generate random numbers.

2.Define the stochastic_hill_climbing function which takes a list of numbers as input.

3.Generate a random index within the range of the list numbers using random.randint(0, len(numbers) - 1). This index will be used as the starting point for the algorithm.

4.Initialize current_max to be the value at the randomly chosen index numbers[current_index]. This value represents the current maximum found so far.

5.Set a limit on the number of iterations to avoid infinite loops. In this code, the limit is set to 100 iterations.

6.Begin iterating for a fixed number of times (100 iterations in this case).

7.In each iteration:
  a. Generate another random index next_index within the range of the list numbers.
  b. Check if the value at numbers[next_index] is greater than the current maximum (current_max).
  c. If it is greater, update current_max to be numbers[next_index]. This represents climbing to a higher point.

8.After all iterations are completed, return the current_max, which holds the maximum value found during the iterations.

9.Outside the function, define a list of numbers.

10.Call the stochastic_hill_climbing function with the list of numbers.

11.Print the maximum number found by the algorithm.

program:

import random

def stochastic_hill_climbing(numbers):

    current_index = random.randint(0, len(numbers) - 1)

    current_max = numbers[current_index]

    iterations = 100 # Limit the number of iterations to avoid infinite loops

    for _ in range(iterations):

        next_index = random.randint(0, len(numbers) - 1)

        if numbers[next_index] > current_max:

            current_max = numbers[next_index]

    

    return current_max

# Example list of numbers

numbers = [1, 3, 7, 12, 9, 5]

max_number = stochastic_hill_climbing(numbers)

print(f"The maximum number in the list is: {max_number}")

OUTPUT:

The maximum number in the list is: 12
